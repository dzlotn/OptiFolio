  Our project optimizes a user’s investment portfolio based on given
  risk or investment return constraints. The interface prompts the user
  for their investment goals and a list of current assets (if they have
  any). Based on the user’s responses, the program will call a stock API
  and return investment recommendations based on their risk tolerance.
